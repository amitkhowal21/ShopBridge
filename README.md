This is temp repository for Thinkbridge technical assignment 

## Overview

As per my view there are many things which need to be develop in this module as this manage inventory of product with other modules but I focused on basic things and try to cover all required functionalities because of time-line.

Though in E-Commerce application there should be many more things there like 

- Product Manufacturer
- Product brands
- Attributes 
- Variants 
- Images 
- Shipping details
- Stock management
 

but due to time limitations I have skipped these points.

## Application Setup

 - **Clone repository**
 - **Create Database-** Go to Database folder and run DB Script sql file in SSMS to create New DB (**Because I have used Database First Approach** )
 - **Run Code-** Go to Codebase folder and open solution in Visual Studio and clean & rebuild it.
 - **Connection String-** Go to Config/connection.config file and change the connection string of database.
